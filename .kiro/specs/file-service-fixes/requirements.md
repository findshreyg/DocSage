# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The file services module has several critical issues that prevent it from functioning correctly. These include missing imports, undefined constants, incomplete schema definitions, and incorrect usage of external dependencies. This feature addresses these issues to restore proper functionality to the file upload, metadata extraction, and adaptive document processing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file service to have all necessary imports and dependencies properly defined, so that the service can start without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the file_handler.py module is imported THEN all required classes and functions SHALL be available without ImportError
2. WHEN the utils.py module is imported THEN all required classes and functions SHALL be available without ImportError
3. WHEN the schemas.py module is imported THEN all Pydantic models SHALL be properly defined and validated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all environment variables and constants to be properly defined and used consistently, so that the service can connect to AWS resources correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN all required environment variables SHALL be loaded from the .env file
2. WHEN DynamoDB operations are performed THEN the correct table names SHALL be used from environment variables
3. WHEN S3 operations are performed THEN the correct bucket name SHALL be used from environment variables
4. WHEN AWS clients are initialized THEN the correct region SHALL be specified

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the adaptive extraction functionality to work correctly with proper schema definitions, so that document processing can extract structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adaptive extraction is requested THEN the AdaptiveExtractRequest schema SHALL be properly validated
2. WHEN adaptive extraction completes THEN the AdaptiveExtractResponse schema SHALL be properly structured
3. WHEN classification results are returned THEN the ClassificationResult schema SHALL contain valid data
4. WHEN field values are extracted THEN the FieldValueWithConfidence schema SHALL contain confidence scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions to be properly defined and accessible, so that JSON parsing and other common operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM responses need JSON extraction THEN the extract_json_from_llm_response function SHALL be available
2. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN utility functions are called THEN they SHALL return expected data types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file upload process to handle metadata extraction and adaptive processing correctly, so that uploaded documents are properly processed and stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN basic metadata extraction SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN adaptive extraction is performed THEN the results SHALL be properly integrated into the metadata
3. WHEN metadata is saved to DynamoDB THEN the correct table and format SHALL be used
4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN appropriate fallback behavior SHALL be implemented
